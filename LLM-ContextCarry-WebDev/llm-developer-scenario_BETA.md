# Updated Scenario: Alice and her LLM Code Copilot

Alice is a junior developer working on a web application using Django and HTMX. She's using an LLM code copilot to assist her in the development process. Here's how their interaction unfolds, now including progress summaries:

## Day 1: Initial Development and First Summary

1. Alice starts a new chat session with her LLM copilot. She describes her project and asks for help setting up a basic structure for a Django application with HTMX integration.

2. The LLM provides a code snapshot of a basic Django app structure with HTMX setup. Alice implements this in her local environment.

3. As they work through the session, Alice and the LLM engage in incremental development, gradually building out views, templates, and HTMX interactions.

4. Nearing the end of the chat session, Alice asks the LLM to summarize their progress.

5. The LLM provides a concise summary of what they've accomplished:
   ```
   Summary of Progress - Day 1:
   - Set up basic Django project structure
   - Created initial app with views and templates
   - Integrated HTMX for dynamic content loading
   - Implemented user registration functionality
   - Started work on the main dashboard view
   ```

6. Alice copies this summary into her progress log.

7. She takes a final code snapshot of what they've achieved and saves it locally.

## Day 2: Continuation, Context Carryover, and Progress Update

1. Alice starts a new chat session, performing a session resume by pasting the code snapshot from the previous day and the progress summary.

2. She tells the LLM, "I'm starting this session with the code snapshot and progress summary from our previous chat. Let's continue developing from this checkpoint."

3. The LLM acknowledges the code state and previous progress, and they continue the incremental development process.

4. During this session, they encounter a bug with HTMX event handling. The LLM suggests reverting to a previous code checkpoint from earlier in the day when the specific feature was working correctly.

5. At the end of the session, Alice again asks for a progress summary.

6. The LLM provides an updated summary:
   ```
   Summary of Progress - Day 2:
   - Expanded dashboard functionality with HTMX for real-time updates
   - Implemented user profile editing
   - Fixed bug in HTMX event handling for form submissions
   - Started integration with a third-party API for data retrieval
   - Improved error handling and user feedback mechanisms
   ```

7. Alice adds this new summary to her progress log, maintaining a clear record of their development journey.

## Subsequent Days: Ongoing Development and Regular Summaries

- Alice continues this pattern of development, always starting with the previous code snapshot and progress summary.
- At the end of each session, she requests a new summary from the LLM, which she then adds to her growing progress log.
- This practice helps Alice maintain a clear understanding of her project's evolution and aids in planning future development steps.

Throughout this process, Alice is not only learning Django and HTMX but also important concepts in code management, context preservation, and progress tracking. The LLM helps bridge the gap between coding and project management, preparing Alice for working in professional development environments.
