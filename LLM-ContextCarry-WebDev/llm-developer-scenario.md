# Scenario: Alice and her LLM Code Copilot

Alice is a junior developer working on a web application. She's using an LLM code copilot to assist her in the development process. Here's how their interaction might unfold:

## Day 1: Initial Development

1. Alice starts a new chat session with her LLM copilot. She describes her project and asks for help setting up a basic structure for a React application.

2. The LLM provides a code snapshot of a basic React app structure. Alice implements this in her local environment.

3. As they work through the session, Alice and the LLM engage in incremental development, gradually building out components and functionality.

4. Nearing the character limit of the chat session, Alice decides to wrap up. She takes a final code snapshot of what they've achieved and saves it locally.

## Day 2: Continuation and Context Carryover

1. Alice starts a new chat session, performing a session resume by pasting the code snapshot from the previous day.

2. She tells the LLM, "I'm starting this session with the code snapshot from our previous chat. Let's continue developing from this checkpoint."

3. The LLM acknowledges the code state and they continue the incremental development process.

4. During this session, they encounter a bug. The LLM suggests reverting to a previous code checkpoint from earlier in the day when the specific feature was working correctly.

## Day 3: Branching and Experimentation

1. Alice begins with another session handover, providing the latest code snapshot.

2. She decides to experiment with a new feature but doesn't want to lose her current stable version. She asks the LLM about managing this.

3. The LLM introduces the concept of branching from version control systems, suggesting Alice could maintain separate code snapshots: one for the stable version and one for experimentation.

4. They proceed with code persistence for the stable version while creating a new "experimental branch" snapshot for the new feature development.

## Day 4: Code Review and Optimization

1. Alice starts with a context carryover, providing both the stable and experimental code snapshots.

2. She asks the LLM to review the differences between the snapshots and suggest optimizations.

3. The LLM performs a comparative analysis, providing feedback and suggestions for improving the code.

4. They work on refactoring and optimizing, creating new code checkpoints at significant improvement milestones.

Throughout this process, Alice is learning not just coding, but also important concepts in code management and version control, all within the context of working with an LLM code copilot. The LLM helps bridge the gap between informal code snapshots and more formal version control practices, preparing Alice for working in professional development environments.
