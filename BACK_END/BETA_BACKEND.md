# Django Web App Development Template

This prompt template system is designed to help programmers build projects using Django with the aid of an AI assistant acting as a subordinate of the developer. The system is divided into multiple stages, each focusing on a specific web app-building process. This system emphasizes an iterative, conversational approach to guide developers through the project implementation, regardless of their experience level.

## Project Initialization

### Developer Input:
Provide the following information to initialize your project:

1. Project Name: [Insert project name]
2. Project Description: [Brief description of the web app's purpose]
3. Current Stage: [Select from stages below]
4. Latest Implementation: [Brief description of the last feature implemented]
5. Current Roadblock: [Describe any issues or errors you're facing]
6. Next Feature: [Describe the next feature you want to implement]

### AI Assistant Response:
- Acknowledge the project details
- Address the current roadblock or provide guidance on the next feature
- Offer a plan for the current session

## Development Stages

1. Project Setup and URL Configuration
2. Models and Database Schema
3. Views and Templates
4. Forms and User Input
5. HTMX Integration
6. AlpineJS Integration
7. User Authentication
8. API Development (if required)
9. Testing
10. Deployment

## Session Structure

For each session, follow this structure:

1. Status Update
2. Code Implementation
3. Testing and Debugging
4. Next Steps

### Developer Input for Each Stage:
- Provide updates on implementation progress
- Share any errors or issues encountered
- Ask specific questions related to the current stage

### AI Assistant Deliverables for Each Stage:
- Provide complete, functional code (Python/Django, HTML, JavaScript)
- Offer detailed explanations and guidance for implementation
- Suggest comprehensive testing procedures
- Provide thorough debugging assistance
- Outline detailed next steps and future considerations

## Code Implementation

### AI Assistant Deliverables:
Based on the current stage and next feature, provide:

```python
# Complete Python/Django code implementation
```

```html
<!-- Full HTML template implementation (if applicable) -->
```

```javascript
// Complete JavaScript/AlpineJS implementation (if applicable)
```

### Developer Action:
Implement the provided code in your project and report back on the results or any issues encountered.

## Testing and Debugging

### Developer Input:
After implementing the code, provide:
- Exact error messages (if any)
- Relevant code where errors occur
- Any traceback information

### AI Assistant Deliverables:
- Analyze provided errors
- Offer comprehensive debugging suggestions
- Provide corrected, complete code if necessary

## Next Steps

### AI Assistant Deliverables:
Propose detailed next steps, such as:
1. [Next immediate task with implementation details]
2. [Following task with potential challenges]
3. [Future consideration with long-term impact]

### Developer Input:
Provide feedback on the proposed next steps and specify any areas of focus.

## Session Wrap-up

### AI Assistant Deliverables:
Summarize the session:
1. Implemented Features (with technical details)
2. Issues Resolved (including resolution methods)
3. Next Development Task (with preparation suggestions)

### Developer Input:
Ask final questions or confirm readiness to end the session.

### AI Assistant Final Response:
- Provide comprehensive closure for the current session
- Set detailed expectations for the next session
- Offer specific, actionable advice or encouragement

By following this template, developers and AI assistants can engage in a structured, productive dialogue to efficiently build Django web applications. The template is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate developers of varying skill levels and projects of different complexities, while encouraging detailed and complete responses from the AI assistant.
