Understood. I'm here to assist you with web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll help you save time and effort in your projects.

Based on the provided documents, it seems we're working within a Django web app development framework. We'll be using HTMX as the preferred frontend methodology, followed by AlpineJS, and Vanilla JS as a last resort.

To get started, could you please provide me with the following information:

1.  Project Name
2.  Project Description
3.  Current Stage of development
4.  Latest Implementation (if any)
5.  Current Roadblock (if any)
6.  Next Feature you want to implement

Once you provide this information, I'll be able to offer more targeted assistance and guide you through the development process.

Project Name: QuizMaster (Simple Quiz App) Project Description: QuizMaster is a web-based quiz application inspired by popular platforms like Quizizz and Kahoot. It allows users to create and take quizzes. Single-player mode is what I aiming for. Current focus is on multiple-choice quizzes; later after I finish successfully deploying the app, I might add other functionalities like other simple quiz types, like True/False, reorder or flashcards etc. Stack: I'm using Django framework for the backend. The front-end utilizes HTMX and AlpineJS to deliver interactive user experience. Current Stage of development: stage 3 Views and Templates and stage 4 Forms and User Input (as per development tempalate given to you) Latest Implementation (if any): Implemented custom template tag See code existing codebase: Current Roadblock (if any): Problem: Take a quiz on homepage, answer all questions, then click Submit button; then redirect to the page: /results/<int>/ Showing the following message: <div class="bg-white dark:bg-\[#0d1117\] rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6"> <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-\[#6e7681\] dark:text-\[#c9d1d9\]">Error</h1> <p class="text-\[#8b949e\] dark:text-\[#8b949e\] mb-6">An unexpected error occurred: Invalid filter: 'div'</p> <a href="/" class="bg-\[#238636\] text-white rounded-full py-2 px-4 hover:bg-\[#238636\]/80 transition-colors">Return to Home</a> </div>

Next Feature you want to implement: Continue with finishing stage 3 and 4, so we can move to the next stage (Stage 5. HTMX Integration).

Thank you for providing the detailed information about your QuizMaster project. I understand that you're currently working on stages 3 and 4 of development, focusing on Views and Templates, and Forms and User Input. Let's address the current roadblock and then move forward with the implementation.

Let's start by fixing the current roadblock:

1.  The error message suggests that there's an invalid filter 'div' being used in your template. This is likely in the `quiz_results.html` template. Let's check and fix this issue.

Open the `quiz_results.html` file and look for any usage of the `|div` filter. It's possible that you meant to use the `|divisibleby` filter or a custom `divide` filter. Let's replace it with the correct filter.

Updated quiz\_results.html

Click to open code

In this updated version, I've replaced the problematic `div` filter with the `widthratio` template tag, which is built-in to Django and performs the division and multiplication for percentage calculation.

2.  Now, let's update the `quiz_extras.py` file to include the `divide` filter, just in case it's needed elsewhere:

Updated quiz\_extras.py

Click to open code

This update ensures that you have a `divide` filter available if needed.

3.  Next, let's review and update the `quiz_results` view in `views.py` to make sure it's passing all the necessary context to the template:

Updated quiz\_results view

Click to open code

These changes should resolve the current roadblock you're facing with the quiz results page.

Now, let's move on to the next steps for implementing the remaining parts of stages 3 and 4:

1.  Enhance the quiz taking experience:
    *   Add a timer to the quiz (if not already implemented).
    *   Implement a progress bar to show how many questions are left.
2.  Improve the quiz creation process:
    *   Add validation to ensure at least one answer is marked as correct.
    *   Allow reordering of questions and answers.
3.  Implement user authentication:
    *   Create login and registration pages.
    *   Restrict quiz creation to authenticated users.
4.  Enhance the user profile:
    *   Show quiz history and statistics.
    *   Allow users to edit their profile information.
5.  Implement search and filtering:
    *   Add a search bar to find quizzes by title or category.
    *   Implement category-based filtering on the home page.

Would you like me to start working on any of these features, or do you have a specific area you'd like to focus on next?
