# Django Web App Development LLM Prompt Template

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive prompt template designed to facilitate the development of Django web applications with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs). The template provides a structured approach to guide both developers and AI assistants through the entire process of building a Django web app, from project initialization to deployment.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this template are to:

1. Streamline the development process for Django web applications.
2. Provide a consistent framework for interaction between developers and AI assistants.
3. Ensure comprehensive and detailed responses from LLMs, promoting the creation of fully functional code.
4. Accommodate developers of varying skill levels and projects of different complexities.

## Key Features

- Structured development stages covering all aspects of Django web app creation
- Clear guidelines for both developer input and AI assistant deliverables
- Emphasis on complete, functional code rather than brief snippets
- Iterative, conversational approach to problem-solving and feature implementation
- Comprehensive testing and debugging procedures
- Detailed session wrap-ups and next steps planning

## How to Use

1. **Project Initialization**: Begin by providing your project details, including the project name, description, current stage, and next feature to implement.

2. **Development Stages**: Follow the outlined stages, from project setup to deployment. Each stage includes specific instructions for both the developer and the AI assistant.

3. **Session Structure**: Adhere to the provided session structure: Status Update, Code Implementation, Testing and Debugging, and Next Steps.

4. **Code Implementation**: Expect and implement complete, functional code provided by the AI assistant for each feature or component.

5. **Testing and Debugging**: Provide detailed error information when issues arise, and follow the AI's comprehensive debugging suggestions.

6. **Session Wrap-up**: Review the session summary, including implemented features, resolved issues, and next development tasks.

## Best Practices

- Be as specific as possible when describing features, roadblocks, or errors.
- Implement the provided code fully and report back on results or issues.
- Engage in iterative dialogue with the AI assistant for optimal results.
- Regularly review and update your project goals and timeline.
